We need to select gender and then enter age, height in either cm or ft/in and weight, then click on 'Calculate' button to get our bmi result.

Input Validations:
==================
=> error messagebox appears when we click on Calculate...
1. if age, height or weight is empty.

2. if height measurements have been filled in both cm and ft/in.

3. if height measurements have not been filled in neither cm nor ft/in.

4. if height measurements have been filled in inches but not in feet. Feet measurements should be always present if ft/in is been used for calculations. If inches measurement is not given then it will be default to 0.
